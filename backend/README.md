# Before starting the server

Get all the userdata in the json file for temporary basis by running `node getData.js` in terminal.

This will download and write the userdata as a 'temporary database' in the json file.

After this start the server using `yarn run dev`

## Would highly recommend to use yarn but using npm won't break anyway.
